            <p>
                I decided to change up the website for multiple reasons. The first being the fact that the old one was very broing.
                It was not optimised very well and looked kinda lame. This website looks better (bc i just stole them theme from sr.ht)
                and I like the new file structure of the site aswell.
            </p>
            <h3>New File Structure</h3>
            <p>
                I changed the way pages and files are layed out on the website. The old layout had everything as a static html file.
                Here it is still HTML, but they are all index.html files inside their own folders. This makes typing in URL's easier.
                I will eventually create a sitemap, but for now, their is none. Anyways thank you for reading this short blog post, more to come to the site soon, so stay tuned.
