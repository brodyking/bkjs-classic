                  I changed the newtab pages to have a search box. Before I tried this but I was lazy and was using the default google custom search engine or whatever.
                  It was really bad and I gave up at the time. Until today!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I learned that all a google search is, is a URL you visit. Say I googled:
                </p>
                <pre>Why is my dog dead</pre>
                <p>
                  it would redirect me to 
                </p>
                <pre>https://google.com/search?=why-is-my-dog-dead</pre>
                <p>
                  So I just made a input box that goes to that URL with your search added to the end of it. 
                  I also made it autoselect so you can just start typing when you are on the page.
                </p>

                <h3>What is bprog?</h3>
                <p>
                  bprog is a project I started last week and felt really motivated to work on but I kinda lost interest.
                  I will keep it on the website for now but I dont know if I will keep working on it.
