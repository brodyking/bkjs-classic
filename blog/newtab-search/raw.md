#NewTab Changes
I changed the newtab pages to have a search box. Before I tried this but I was lazy and was using the default google custom search engine or whatever. It was really bad and I gave up at the time. Until today!

I learned that all a google search is, is a URL you visit. Say I googled:

Why is my dog dead?

it would redirect me to

https://google.com/search?=asdf

So I just made a input box that goes to that URL with your search added to the end of it. I also made it autoselect so you can just start typing when you are on the page.

#What is bprog?
bprog is a project I started last week and felt really motivated to work on but I kinda lost interest. I will keep it on the website for now but I dont know if I will keep working on it.
