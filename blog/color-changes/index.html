                <p>
                    I recently did some maintence on this website. Every few weeks I randomly get the urge to change things up, and this time is what the color scheme.
                </p>
                <h2>The inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking at <a href="https://wdg.one/">wdg</a> and saw some cool looking sites on there.
                    When I was comparing them to mine I felt like mine was lacking a bit. So I sat down and made a list of what I didnt like.
                </p>
                <h2>The changes</h2>
                <p>
                    Here is a list of everything I changed on this site.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Changed primary color from <blue>blue</blue> to <highlight>red</highlight>.</li>
                    <li>Removed the banner from all pages except the <a href="../../">homepage</a> and the <a href="../../pages/newtab/">newtab</a> pages.</li>
                    <li>Correct font for <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> inside of blog posts.</li>
                    <li>Hovering on my profile picture dosent make it a box.</li>
                    <li>Mobile Support.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    For alot of people these changes seem small, but I want to document them somewhere.
                </p>
                <h2>To-do list</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, I have a few modifications to the site I want to make that I dont have time for currently. Here is a list of them.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Change <a href="../">blog</a> page to display them differently than a grid.</li>
                    <li>Move site to be hosted somewhere else. (thats not github pages)</li>
                    <li>Create more content for the site.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    These modifications dont really matter though, so I will probobly procrastinate about it for a few months.
                </p>
