                <p>
                    /pages/ is a new directory where all old one-off pages will be stored.
                    All pages except for /homepage/. I'm going to keep /homepage/ in the main directory because some people might have it bookmarked and I dont feel like changing it.
                    Here is a list of everything I have moved their.
                </p>
                <pre>/contact/ ===> /pages/contact/
/newtab/ ===> /pages/newtab/
/deprecated/ ===> /pages/deprecated/</pre>
                <p>
                    I hope the new change makes the site easier to navigate if you type in manual URL's.
                    You can also see all of the pages at the <a href="../../pages/">/pages/</a> URL. This page also shows when the last time the page was updated, somthing previously not shown.
                </p>
                <h3>Displayed URL Change</h3>
                <p>
                    I changed the way that URLs look on pages like /projects/ or /pages/.
                    Instead of it saying somthing like /kimmu/ it now says /projects/kimmu/. Before the naming system didnt make any sense and I wanted to make the slashes do somthing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thats all for now. Expect a new blog post in a few days about another OCD site restructure :) byeeeee
